A (fake) movie purchase website where you can buy and stream movies.

## Description

Square Eyes is the first website I have created as part of a cross course project at Noroff as a Front-end Developer. I made a Wireframe and design in Figma, and built the site using HTML and CSS. Also used Javascript to fetch from the WooCommerce API to show the products/films and itÂ´s content like descriptions and prices. The was made to be responsive and the user is able to go from picking a movie all the way to checkout.


## Built With
